    <h2>CHILDHOOD & EDUCATION OF DEEPIKA</h2>

    <p>Deepika Padukone (born 5 January 1986) is a Danish–born Indian movie actress and model. One of the highest-paid Indian celebrities, she has established a career in Bollywood films, and is the recipient of two Filmfare Awards
    Deepika in her segment reveals that she has only completed her education till 12th standard and is not a graduate even though her parents wanted her to have a basic qualification while she pursued her passion for modelling and acting. She also sheds light on the fact that she did enroll in the distance mode of education to complete her graduation, but failed</p>
    <p>In Batch of 2020, Deepika also sheds light on not being the brightest of students in her batch, academically, and how she once had to 'temporarily make a new group of friends' since all her class mates were busy being popular by excelling in music, studies etc. Deepika further reveals that she was more inclined towards non-academic things in school and was excited about inter-school competitions, sports, theatre etc.
    In her own words, Deepika says, "I just hated academics. It was never really a passion of mine- education, learning. I always felt like I didn't have to go through academics to sort of be successful or be whatever."
    Reflecting on her school life, Deepika says, "Exams, tests, none of it ever made any sense to me. I'd say average or below average was where I usually sat. In high school it got to a place where temporarily I formed a new set of friends because my friends were so busy being head girl of the band, head girl of school, head girl of something else. My friends got really popular in school. They were busy doing all of those things. I kind of got left behind because I didn't know what to do. I was never considered a bright student."</p><br><br>


    <h2>PERSONAL LIFE</h2>

    <p>Padukone shares a close bond with her family, and visits them regularly in her hometown of Bangalore. She lives in Prabhadevi, a neighbourhood in Mumbai, and has admitted to missing the presence of her parents there. A practicing Hindu, Padukone considers religion to be an important aspect of her life and makes frequent visits to temples and other religious shrines.
    While filming Bachna Ae Haseeno in 2008, Padukone began a romantic relationship with co-star Ranbir Kapoor. She spoke openly about the relationship and sported a tattoo of his initials on the nape of her neck. She has said that the relationship had a profound effect on her, transforming her into a more confident and social person.</p>
    <p>The Indian media speculated on an engagement, and reported that this had occurred in November 2008, although Padukone had stated that she had no plans to marry within the next five years.The couple broke up a year later; she professed in an interview to feeling betrayed for a long time. In a 2010 interview, Padukone accused him of infidelity, and Kapoor later admitted to it.They reconciled their friendship while working on Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani.
    Padukone subsequently became reticent to discuss her personal life, but in 2017, she fondly spoke of her relationship with her frequent co-star Ranveer Singh, whom she began dating in 2012. In November 2018, the couple married in traditional Konkani and Sindhi ceremonies at Lake Como, Italy.</p><br><br>
